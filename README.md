If you haven't got anything constructive to say about my blog, then go look in the mirror. Your hair looks _awful_ today.

## Styleguide

I maintain a styleguide for the blog which contains examples of common components and design patterns I use at [www.claireparker.co.uk/styleguide](http://www.claireparker.co.uk/styleguide). The styleguide is built using Astrum.

## Development

### Run locally

`jekyll serve` - builds and runs locally at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`

### Rake tasks

#### Write a new blog post

`rake new_post[my-new-post]` or `rake new_post['my new post']`

Or just copy the format of one already in the `_posts` folder, filling in the yaml as necessary ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

#### Write a new `interesting` post

`rake interesting` and follow the prompts.

The things you're interersted in that week are saved in a blog post as bullet points in the yaml config under the `interests` property.

### Gulp tasks

`gulp css` - builds and minifies the CSS, with a bit of uncss-ing included. Bit broken at the moment as you have to do this manually instead of it hooking into jekyll's recompilation stuff.
