# Talks

* I gave a lightning talk called "Coding After Codecademy" at Manchester Ladies Who Code event in October 2015. I'm the first speaker in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ofo6NvZtz3A&feature=youtu.be).

* I also talked about the Pomodoro Technique at an Ada Lovelace day event held at Infinity Works Leeds in October 2015 but alas they didn't record it, you'll have to take my word for it!

# Other

* An Tweet of a _flattering_ #ilooklikeanengineer photo including me made it into [the Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/ilooklikeanengineer-women-mark-ada-lovelace-day-with-selfies-fighting-sexism-a6692141.html) in an article about Ada Lovelace day (5th Tweet down)
