I was going to call this post "101 days of coding", but that would be misleading. I've been getting paid to write code as a web developer for over two years now, but over the past 3+ months I've been writing code - for fun, after work, after housework, after slobbing in front of the TV - and then committing and pushing it to GitHub. I've done this every day since the 1st of January this year and now I have a streak going on - look at my GitHub scorecard:

## Why??

* Because I am a sucker for gameificiation. I :yellow_heart: seeing those little squares go green and watching that streak getting bigger and bigger each day. (you may have heard of this trick before as [Don't Break the Chain](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret).
* Because I love coding - this is not a chore for me and I still enjoy developing even after doing it all day at work.
* Because this is when I learn new things - with the rapid pace of change in web development it's really important to keep learning new things and improving your skills. I don't get time to try out the latest thing at work because ... I'm at work, doing my job. Playing around with things at home means I have time to learn things at my own pace projec pressure, and putting it on GitHub means it's available for future reference

## How?

I'm on my computer every day anyway, so it's not a big stretch to close Twitter and open Atom instead and write some code.

I don't write 1000 lines a day: some days I'll make 10 commits, others I'll only have time for 1. When I'm short on time it will be rewriting a Readme, or adding code coverage to a project, or tinkering with styling. Most nights I'll spend between half an hour to an hour coding. And remember time spent coding is not proportional to the lines of code written, nor are all commits created equally.

## But, why? Who cares?

No one cares but me! I'm fully aware that having a streak on GitHub doesn't make you a good coder, or make you perform better at your job, or imply anything at all about your skillset, but I'm finding it a huge motivator for me to stop procrastinating and frittering my time away on social media and instead to get better at something I love. The small bit of work that I put in every day (e.g. adding localstorage to a Backbone app, or adding multiple choice prompts to my Yeoman generator, or converting some ES5 to ES6) is improving my skills every day and has made me feel already, in April, since January, a much stronger and more confident software developer in terms of writing code and building apps from scratch rather than just "knowing" about that technology and never having got my hands dirty. None of the apps or projects that I'm working on are going to change the world or make me a millionaire: they're just hobby projects that I use to hone my skills.

It never feels like a chore, or believe me there would be a large white gap after January 2nd. I don't let it get in the way of my social life or other commitments. My other half is aware of my current streak, but it's not that hard or disruptive to take 30 minutes out of a day and sit on the computer. How much time do you think you spend on Twitter and Facebook already?

I haven't got an end date - just look at [John Resig's over 2 year streak](https://github.com/jeresig)! - I'm just taking it one day at a time.

## What I've worked on in the first 100 days

* this blog (8+ posts)
* a Yeoman generator to build Jekyll posts for my blog
* published 5 npm modules
 * created CLI in Node
 * fully tested said-modules and set up continuous integration and code coverage (but all my code backed up by unit tests as standard, yours should be too! :D)
 * built functions in ES6
* Backbone apps (I knew 0 Backbone on 1st January)
* a package for the Atom text editor using CoffeeScript
* web scraping with Ruby
