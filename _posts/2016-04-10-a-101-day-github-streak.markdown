I was going to call this post "101 days of coding", but that would be misleading. I've been getting paid to write code as a web developer for over two years now, but over the past 3+ months I've been writing code in my spare time - after work, after housework, after slobbing in front of the TV - and then committing and pushing it to GitHub. The really weird and pointless thing about this is that I've done it every day since the 1st of January this year and now I have a pretty good streak, just look at my GitHub scorecard:

:clap::clap::clap:

## Why??

* _Because I am a sucker for [gamificiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification)_ - I :yellow_heart: seeing those little squares go green and watching that streak getting bigger and bigger each day. (you may have come across this before as a trick to build a habit called [Don't Break the Chain](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret))
* _Because I genuinely enjoy coding_ - this isn't a chore for me and I still enjoy developing even after doing it all day at work, although not code related to work of course.
* _Because this is my time to learn new things_ - there's always something new to learn in web development and it's very important to keep stay on top of things. I don't get time to try out the latest thing at work because ... I'm at work, doing my job. Playing around with things at home means I have time to learn things at my own pace project pressure, and putting it on GitHub means it's available for future reference.

The gamification of the GitHub scorecard feature has helped me build a regular habit to study and code a little each day, and to get side-projects and practice apps to a reasonable, useful state instead of discarding them after 30 minutes when the new technology becomes mildly challenging.

## How?

I'm on my computer every day anyway, so it's not a big stretch to close Twitter and open Atom instead and write some code.

I don't write 1000 lines a day: some days I'll make 10 commits, others I'll only have time for 1. When I'm short on time it might be something that doesn't involve too much thinking, a task I've done before like adding code coverage to a project, or tinkering with styling. Most nights I'll spend between half an hour to an hour coding. And remember time spent coding is not proportional to the lines of code written (especially if you're debugging! :bug:), nor are all commits created equal.

## But, why? Who cares?

No one cares but me! I'm fully aware that having a streak on GitHub doesn't make you a good coder, or make you perform better at your job, or imply anything at all about your skillset, but I'm finding it a huge motivator for me to stop procrastinating and frittering my time away on social media and instead to get better at something I :purple_heart:. It's nice not to feel my brain dribbling out my earhole while watching Netflix or scrolling through a newsfeed.

The small bit of work that I put in every day (e.g. adding localstorage to a Backbone app, or adding multiple choice prompts to my Yeoman generator, or converting some ES5 to ES6) adds up learning a lot over time and has made me feel already, in just over 3 months, a much stronger and more confident software developer in terms of writing code and building apps from scratch rather than just "knowing" about that technology and never having got my hands dirty. None of the apps or projects that I'm working on are going to change the world or make me a millionaire: they're just hobby projects that I use to hone my skills.

Don't worry, I have a healthy balance between real-person relationships and IRL activities and my computer. My other half is aware of my current streak, but it's not that hard or disruptive to take 30 minutes out of a day and sit on the computer and it doesn't stop me from fulfilling any other commitments. How much time do you think you spend on Twitter and Facebook already?

I haven't got an end date - just look at [John Resig's over 2 year streak](https://github.com/jeresig)! - I'm just taking it one day at a time. :sun_with_face:

## What I've worked on in the first 100 days

* this blog
* a Yeoman generator to build Jekyll posts for my blog
* published 5 npm modules, some of which use CLIs in Node, others use ES6
* fully tested said-modules and set up continuous integration and code coverage (but all my code backed up by unit tests as standard, yours should be too! :D)
* Backbone apps (my Backbone knowledge was `null` on 1st January)
* a package for the Atom text editor using CoffeeScript
* web scraping with Ruby
