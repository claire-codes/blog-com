Are you working on a large project in Atom? Dozens of directories? Thousands of files? Innumerable node modules? You may have discovered that Atom isn't the fatest editor out there when executing search queries across an entire project. Give Atom a helping hand by narrowing down the scope of your search with a few simple tricks.

<div class="c-tldr">
    <h2 class="c-tldr__title">TL;DR</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Exclude a directory from your search by adding an exclamation point in front of its name: <code>!node_modules/</code></li>
        <li>Include or exclude several directories by separating their file paths with commas: <code>web/, !static/</code></li>
        <li>Search for for a specific file type in all subdirectories: <code>frontend/**/*.js</code></li>
   </ul>
</div>

_Note_: The trailing slashes are optional - I use them for clarity here to indicate a folder rather than a file.

Every piece of functionality in Atom is provided by a package, and the search panel is no different. When you press <kbd>Cmd + Shift + F</kbd> on a Mac or <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + F</kbd> on Windows the search panel appears, courtesy of the [find-and-replace package](https://atom.io/packages/find-and-replace). Your search term goes in the first box, and any of the patterns in the following tips are placed in the third "File/directory pattern" box.

## 1. Exclude gitignored files

Open the Core Settings menu and make sure the **Exclude VCS Ignored Paths** option is selected. Now every file and directory in your `.gitignore` file will be excluded from your search. Typically you would add the `node_modules/` directory in the `.gitignore` file so that they aren‚Äôt committed to your repo, which can provide a big win in terms of search speed for JavaScript based projects

## 2. Search in a specific directory

Do you only want to search for the string "cheezeburger" in the `kittehs/` directory? Then enter this path in the Find and Replace panel before hitting return to narrow the search scope to this folder.

## 3. Search in multiple specific directories

Do you only want to search in either the `kittehs/` folder or the `doge/` folder? Then separate their paths with commas to search just within these directories.

## 4. Exclude specific directories from search

How about when you know you definitely don't want to search within a particular folder, but want to look everywhere else in the project? Perhaps you don't want to search within the `tests/` directory for your snippet of code. Perhaps you don't have a `.gitignore` file, or if you do you still need to work with the files and folders listed in it (üëã hello Magento 2 projects and the `vendor/` folder).

It's possible to exclude a directory from the scope of your search by typing its path in the 3rd field preceded by an exclamation point.

For example, look everywhere but the `node_modules/` directory by just typing `!node_modules/` and running the search.

## 5. Include and exclude specific directories

You can combine the previous two techniques by separating the patterns with a comma. This is useful if you want to search within a directory but exclude a subdirectory of it, e.g. `javascript/, !javascript/tests/`.

## 6. Search for file types within directories

You know that you can filter by file type by using the wildcard character and the file extension. To search only in JavaScript files type `*.js`. But say we want to look in JavaScript files in the `web/` directory. If we were to type `web/*.js`, this will only search for JavaScript files directly in the `web/` folder, and not in any of `web/`'s subdirectories (if it has any). To include all subdirectories in the search, use the globstar pattern instead: `web/**/*.js`

These techniques make use of glob patterns, which are a useful skill to know and can be applied to many other editors and searching tools to save millions of milliseconds of your life when searching. ‚è±
