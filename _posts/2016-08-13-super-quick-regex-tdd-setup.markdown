When you need to build a regex you could either (A) hack around in the console, getting confused and lost, or instead (B) write some tests: you can use them to work out all the things your regex should match (and shouldn't match), easily run them to see results, plus your regex is documented for future use üèÜ

This post shows you how quick and painless that can be to setup. Want to get started with Test-Driven-Development (TDD)? Spend the next 5 minutes getting a working example!

### `mkdir regexTest && cd "$_"`

Make new directory and move into it in one command!

### `npm init -y`

Set up a new `package.json` file the quick way - no more hitting enter for all the default options!

### `npm i -D mocha chai`

Install the latest versions of the `mocha` and `chai` packages as devDependencies (although it doesn't really matter if they're devDependencies or normal dependencies as we're not really creating a  production ready app. The save as a straight dependency use the `-S` shortcut).

You should now have something like:

```json
{
  "name": "regexTest",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "Maya Angelou <maya@gmail.com>",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "chai": "^3.5.0",
    "mocha": "^3.0.2"
  }
}
```

Change the `test` property to:

### `"test": "./node_modules/.bin/mocha -R spec"`

If you have mocha installed globally (`npm i -g mocha`) you can just write `mocha -R spec` instead.

The `-R` flag is short for `--reporter` and tells mocha which one we want to use, i.e. how to print out our test results. Here we're using the default `spec` but replace this with `-R nyan` if you want something a bit more fun.

We'll now be able to run the tests with `npm test`. Let's write some to run! Go back to the command line.

### `mkdir test`

### `touch test/regexTest.js`

Mocha wants to run tests that are in the `test` directory but isn't bothered what the files in it are called. You could have `regexSpec.js` or `wazzock.js` if you like.

Open up this file in your text editor and setup a skeleton for our tests:

```javascript
var expect = require('chai').expect;

describe("My amazing regex", function() {
    it("should pass", function() {
        expect(42).to.equal(42);
    });
    
    it("should fail", function() {
        expect(42).not.to.equal("42");
    });
});
```

Now run from the command line:

### `npm test`

And tada :tada: you should see some working specs:

There's no time for an explanation of how Mocha works, but a couple of notes: I prefer the expect rather than assert matchers as I think they are more readable. I'm using the `chai` matchers to make our assertions even easier to read. Plus we're going to group lots of assertions within the `it` functions because life is too short to write a new one for each assertion, especially as this is just a quick example.

Now we can set up some assertions to test a regex. Use this matcher:

### `expect("string").to.match(regex);`

Write your test cases: replace the current contents with the strings your regex should match and the ones it shouldn't (these are just as important and shouldn't be overlooked).

```javascript
describe("My amazing regex", function() {
    var myRegex = /foo/;

    it("should work", function() {
        expect("light").to.match(myRegex);
        expect("highlight").to.match(myRegex);
        expect("lighten").to.match(myRegex);
        expect("reenlighten").to.match(myRegex);
        expect(" light ").to.match(myRegex);
    });

    it("shouldn't work", function() {
        expect("highlighter").not.to.match(myRegex);
        expect("enlighten").not.to.match(myRegex);
        expect("").not.to.match(myRegex);
        expect("blah").not.to.match(myRegex);
        expect("LIGHT").not.to.match(myRegex);
    });
});
```

Note that we'll add a variable to hold the regex but we won't fill it in correctly just yet, because first, we want failing specs! Run `npm test` again:

![My First Specs](/assets/failingspecs.png)

Well OK, the `shouldn't work` block is passing, as our regex is wrong and won't match any of them, which we expect. We use those assertions as our safety net - when we start to write our regex if some of these match then we know we need to fix something in our implementation.

And then all is left is to write a regex that makes all of the tests pass: some strings are matched and others aren't.

```javascript
var myRegex = /^(?!en).*light(?!er)/;
```

And that's all there is to it.
