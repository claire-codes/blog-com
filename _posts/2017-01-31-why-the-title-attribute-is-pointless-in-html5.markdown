I‚Äôve been working a lot with Magento 2 recently (lucky me üòë) and I've noticed the `title` attribute used heavily across the HTML and PHTML template files. I found examples on `<input>`, `<a>` , `<textarea>`, `<p>` and especially `<div>` tags, e.g.

```html
<div title="<?php /* @escapeNotVerified */ echo __(‚ÄòBuy me')?>">
    <?php /* @escapeNotVerified */ echo __(‚ÄòBuy me') ?>
</div>
```

This is the pattern I've seen used: the title attribute is used to repeat the text within the div or an equivalent ‚Äúuseful‚Äù value for other tags.

This isn‚Äôt an attribute I've come across much in the wild, which intrigued me: are the Magento team writing accessible, semantically correct HTML that I should copy? (Spoiler alert: no) So I investigated further.

<div class="c-tldr">
    <h2 class="c-tldr__title">TL;DR</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>It creates a tooltip of the content when the element is hovered over</li>
    <li>Don‚Äôt use tooltips!</li>
    <li><pre>
    if (informationIsImportant === true) {
   print directly to screen;
else (informationIsNotThatImportant === true) {
   don‚Äôt include it in your page;
}</pre></li>
</ul></div>

## What does the title attribute do?

The string provided to the title attribute is presented as a tooltip whenever the element is hovered over. So in theory it contains supplementary information about the element it‚Äôs attached to. Try hovering over this example (if you‚Äôre on a device that allows you to hover of course!):

<div title="You'll only see me if you hover">Hover me</div>

If it isn‚Äôt given an attribute itself but a parent element is, then it inherits and will show that instead.

## Which elements can you use it on?

In HTML5, it‚Äôs valid on any element.

## Why would I use it?

To create a simple tooltip.

## Do I want to create a tooltip?

No. For starters, the HTML spec discourages the use of the title attribute for this purpose. You should not be storing potentially important, useful information in a tooltip, as certain user groups can‚Äôt access it. Storing information only accessible when hovered over means that groups of users can‚Äôt see it:

- smartphone and tablet users are unable to hover
- the title attribute is ignored by screen readers and not read out

## What alternatives are there?

To write clear, concise labels and instructions throughout your site, and negate the need for tooltips.

Is the information useful and does a user need to see it? Then in should be clearly on the screen and not hidden.

Is the information non-essential? Then you should question the validity of it on the page.

There‚Äôs a tonne more detailed information on this on the web of course. Next time I work on a Magento 2 template and see the title attribute I‚Äôll be deleting it to keep my files free of cruft.
