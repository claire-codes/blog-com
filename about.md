Hi, I'm Claire and I'm a web developer based in Manchester.

I mostly write JavaScript and sometimes a bit of Ruby. In my day job I work with Magento.

My hobbies include:

* :bookmark_tabs: Writing lists
* :books: Returning library books the day after they were due
* :family: Reading the bios on tech blogs
* :beetle::smile_cat::mortar_board: Putting too many emojis in social media posts

This blog is a place for me to record interesting and useful things I've learnt about web development so I don't forget them.

I enjoy talking about web development and am always interested in new and exciting projects or speaking opportunities. You can see what I'm capable of on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/claireparker "GitHub").
