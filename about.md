Hi, I'm Claire and I'm a frontend web developer based in Manchester.

I 💚 JavaScript and making snazzy things happen in web browsers. In my day job I work with Magento.

My hobbies include:

* 📑 Writing lists
* 📚 Returning library books the day after they were due
* 👪 Reading the bios on tech blogs
* 🐞😼💁 Putting too many emojis in social media posts

This blog is a place for me to record interesting and useful things I've learnt about web development so I don't forget them.

I enjoy talking about web development and am always interested in new and exciting projects or speaking opportunities. You can see what I'm capable of on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/claireparker "GitHub").
