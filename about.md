Hi, my name is Claire Parker and I'm a web developer based in Yorkshire.

My hobbies include:

* Writing lists
* Returning library books the day after they were due
* Being a professional woman in technology

I like the wacky world of JavaScript and sometimes dabble in Ruby.

I enjoy talking about web development and am always interested in new and exciting projects or speaking opportunities. You can see a bit of what I do on my [http://www.claireparker-pen.com/portfolio/](portfolio page "my portfolio") or check out my [GitHub account](https://github.com/claireparker "GitHub")
